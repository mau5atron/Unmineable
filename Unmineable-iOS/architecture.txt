# Architecture for iOS + Watch Extension
1. iOS app should work the same way it does on macos
2. iOS should be sending background updates to Watch app or have the watch refresh data since it may have an internet	connection
3. Load values periodically 15/30/1hr intervals
4. When opening the standalone app on Watch, last address searched should be searched again
5. etc..
