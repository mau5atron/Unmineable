Overall App:
	- When requesting data, add dropdown to select which crypto we are searching for
	- When opening the app, search for last requested crypto + balance automatically (save options in a plist)
	- Should be able to display earnings in the status bar
	
	- Set timestamp to display the last time we checked our mining address

Issue 9/13/2021:
- The request stuff happens in the mainviewcontroller but I would like to be able to refresh from the context of the AppDelegate menu bar items
- Done

Issue 10/12/2021:
- In macOS with ios 13+, couldn't build the app due to removing the scene delegate file. Could not perform initial screen animation as the Main storyboard file was being
	referenced in the scene delegate file. In info.plist for ios, I removed the "UIApplicationSceneManifest" property with its other nested properties and the issue went away
	and was able to play the animation successfully.
- Fixed certificate hell by going to: build settings > "search signing" > remove provisioning profile


Feature 10/15/2021:
- Add unmineable image skew effect when hovering over image (image rotates left, right, up, down)
	- Detect when user has entered window context
	- start animating rotate effect when mouse is in proximity to the image
	- Add menu option to disable effect if user does not like it
