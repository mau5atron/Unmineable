Overall App:
	- When requesting data, add dropdown to select which crypto we are searching for
	- When opening the app, search for last requested crypto + balance automatically (save options in a plist)
	- Should be able to display earnings in the status bar
	
	- Set timestamp to display the last time we checked our mining address

Issue 9/13/2021:
- The request stuff happens in the mainviewcontroller but I would like to be able to refresh from the context of the AppDelegate menu bar items
